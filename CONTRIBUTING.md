## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CONTRIBUTING.md Code of Conduct](blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- There are times that things break locally due to either other extensions orupstream issues in VS Code. Please try to see if the issue exists in other themes (likely an issue with VS Code itself), and disable other extensions to see if the issue persists.


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.


### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements are welcome! However, due to the nature of a theme, some requests may be subjective, and we may not want to implement them because it could steer the theme away from its intended purpose.


### Submitting a PR

When submitting a PR, please reference the issue by number. If there is no issue, please create one. Please provide a screenshot of the changes you are making, both before and after.
